Things that annoy me with the editor:
1. Randomised scene hierarchy order and component order
2. File explorer always starts in C:\ drive, which makes it extremely slow to open scenes etc.
3. File explorer provides full paths instead of relative paths
4. Window resizing is broken
5. Scene selection weird/broken
6. Can't change entity position in hierarchy
7. Clone doesn't clone entity children
8. No prefabs
9. Working with scene loading/unloading is a pain
10. No scrolling, limited scene size as a result
11. No mouse gizmos for moving stuff around in the scene
12. No key shortcuts
13. Sketchy toolbar setup (not customisable outside engine as of yet either)
14. Immediate mode GUI layout a bit borked
15. Project loading broken if more than one opened scene
16. No copy/paste functionality, besides cloning

Things that I like:
1. Play game button is AMAZING
2. Resizable windows, albeit dodgy/broken
3. Cloning entities, albeit inefficiently, is a great help
