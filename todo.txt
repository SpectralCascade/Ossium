OSSIUM
- Fix entity destruction; all children must be destroyed, currently only their nodes are destroyed!
- Have to set text/update textlayout every time we render?
- Mysterious memory bug - some images do not display in internet trouble for LD 46? Check GetComponent, seems like it returns invalid data??
- System for marking entities and components that should not be saved in scenes within the editor (to deal with autogenerated content)
- System for marking individual schema variables that are dynamically set (e.g. Transform position by a BoxLayout) so only their default values are saved.
