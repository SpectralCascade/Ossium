# Ossium
Ossium is a bare-bones 2D game engine built with SDL 2.

# Pre-requisites
* SDL 2.0.8 (or greater)
* SDL_Image
* SDL_Mixer
* SDL_TTF
All these components are listed on the [SDL website](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

# Additional notes
I'm developing this project using Code::Blocks 17.12 on 64-bit (arm) Linux
with the GNU GCC mingw compiler. However, SDL is a cross-platform framework.
Therefore it should be pretty easy to port it to Windows or Mac OS - check out
Lazy Foo's SDL 2 tutorials at www.lazyfoo.net if you're unfamiliar with SDL.
